## Script metadata (traits)

Every converted map includes additional metadata traits that can be used in gamemodes or map editor plugins.

| Type and Name                        | Version        | Example value                 | Description |

| `Text` `NC2_ConvertedAt`             | 2.0.0-alpha.1+ | `2024-12-19T21:22:03`         | Date and time the conversion happened in ISO 8601 standard.

Versions can be seen bugged as `1.0.0` on NC2 maps due to the projects being versioned about 1 day before the public release, and the maps being converted before that.

#### Traits that are no longer used and supported

| Type and Name               | Version           | Description |
|-----------------------------|-------------------| ----------- |
| `Boolean` `NC2_PreAlpha`    | 2.0.0 (pre-alpha) | Track was converted in pre-alpha of Nations Converter 2. In 2.0.0-alpha.1, it was removed.
| `Boolean` `NC_EarlyAccess`  | 0.1.0-1.3.5       | Conversion was made in NC1 early access. Removed because it is irrelevant.
| `Text` `NC_Assembly`        | 0.1.0-1.3.5       | User interface project version the conversion was made. Removed because format is bloaty and confusing.
| `Text` `NC_GBXNET_Assembly` | 1.0.0-1.3.5       | GBX.NET version used for the Gbx parse. Removed because format is bloaty, use `NC2_GBXNET_Version`.
| `Text` `NC_Lib_Assembly`    | 1.0.2-1.3.5       | Version of the conversion processing library. Removed because format is bloaty, use `NC2_Version`.
